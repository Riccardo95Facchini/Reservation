\subsection{Introduction}
In this section, it will be described with pseudocode the main algorithms of the system.

\subsubsection{Path Calculation}
It should be noted that since the system relies on the APIs of \emph{Google Maps} to actually calculate the path, the \textbf{Path Calculator} component only needs to select the vehicles that the user will have to use (given the his/her preferences, owned vehicles, the weather conditions and the eventuality of strikes), this means that (as already stated) it acts more like a \emph{Query Builder} and then selects the best path if more than one is returned.
