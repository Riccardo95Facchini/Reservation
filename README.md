<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Reservation has been developed for the 2018-2019 Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications at Politecnico di Milano.<br/>
It's intended to be a tool that users would use in order to make reservations in different shops, while the shop owners can see who made the reservations and when. Other functionalities are present and detailed in the [Design Document](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/Reservation/blob/master/Design%20Document/DD.pdf).<br/><br/>

This project was started when the Android development knowledge was less than basic, since then it evolved from the barebones start and has been updated. Many old functionalities haven't been changed during the second and major rework due to the initial architecture being less than favourable to adding and changing what was already done, a better approach would have been to start from scratch but time constraints didn't make it possible.

### Main Features
* Given an address, search radious and a tag, search in an area around that address for shops that fit the tag.
* Chat system.
* Notifications system for new chat messages and reservations.
* One app fits shop owners and users.
